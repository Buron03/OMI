## Description
Don't let the title of the problem fool you, if your program counts to infinity, one of two things is likely to happen:

* The computer gets tired and stops counting.

* You get a time limit exceeded.

So all you have to do is count up to {n}.

<br>

## Input
A number {n}, the number to which you must count.

<br>

## Output
A list of {n} numbers, the numbers from 1 to {n}, each on a line

<br>

## Example
| Input | Output                                             |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | 1                                                  |
| 8     | 1 <br> 2 <br> 3 <br> 4 <br> 5 <br> 6 <br> 7 <br> 8 |

<br>

## Limits
* 1 <= n <= 10,000
